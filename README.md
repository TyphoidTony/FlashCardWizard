FlashCardWizard
===============

Flash Card Wizard is a pretty simple program written purely in Java. In which you'll be able to create Flash cards that you can do drills with. For now the only drilling option will be write the answer down via a textbox. Later, I'll add the option to do multiple choice questions and maybe a timed mode for "drills"

This is just a simple project I've been trying to actually get done for a few months now as a way to propagate me to learn programming.
