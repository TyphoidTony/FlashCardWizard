Flash card wizard.


Flash cards will be 'loaded' one at a time
with a box for the question and a single box for the answer
where the answer once the user hits enter. The answer will then
be pattern-matched against the answer saved on a file.
More akin to actual flashcards, literally writing one at a time.

features to maybe add: timed flash cards,multiple choice questions


-----Overall structure----

FlashOptionsWindow: determines if the user would like to create new flash cards or
make new set.

FlashCardFrame: used to 'write down questions and answers' will also hold the methods and inner classes for
action listeners and the retrieval of the text being put into a txt file (hopefully I can generate a txt file within
the jar)

DeckCreation: will be used to create the files needed for the flash card deck
and will determine if the file name already exists if it does it will prompt the user to
write-over them or to pick a new name.
FileChooser: used to create and instatiate the

FileCreator: Will be used to create open and allow writing of the specific file, should get rid of the clutter and
mis match that is happening within the DeckCreation class as at the moment it is creating and institating things it
should be getting from another class methods to move over should be checkFileExistance(), createFile(), isNameless
and the getQuestionsFile() and getAnswersFile().

CardImage made to remove code duplication. As I was making a new method for each class that retrieved the same image
has single method all it does it get the flashCard image that is being used on all the JFrames

//TODO will continue to add as I move along.
------------------------------

use the randomaccessfile()  to populate an array from the saved questions and answers
user string.split to 'split them at whitespace using a 'delim' variable.


----To implement-------

1)FileSaver/Opener - to load the flash cards
2)getting the right index of the flash card answers and questions
once one is done. (maybe running them through a "stack"?)
3)
