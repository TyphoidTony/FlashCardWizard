Flash card wizard.


Flash cards will be 'loaded' one at a time
with a box for the question and a single box for the answer
where the answer once the user hits enter. The answer will then
be pattern-matched against the answer saved on a file.
More akin to actual flashcards, literally writing one at a time.

features to maybe add: timed flash cards,multiple choice questions


-----Overall structure----

FlashOptionsWindow: determines if the user would like to create new flash cards or
make new set.

FlashCardFrame: used to 'write down questions and answers' will also hold the methods and inner classes for
action listeners and the retrieval of the text being put into a txt file (hopefully I can generate a txt file within
the jar)

DeckCreation: will be used to create the files needed for the flash card deck
and will determine if the file name already exists if it does it will prompt the user to
write-over them or to pick a new name.
FileChooser: used to create and instatiate the

FileCreator: Will be used to create open and allow writing of the specific file, should get rid of the clutter and
mis match that is happening within the DeckCreation class as at the moment it is creating and institating things it
should be getting from another class methods to move over should be checkFileExistance(), createFile(), isNameless
and the getQuestionsFile() and getAnswersFile().

CardImage made to remove code duplication. As I was making a new method for each class that retrieved the same image
has single method all it does it get the flashCard image that is being used on all the JFrames



Moving forward, writing to a file now works. Now to I need to decide if setting this up the way I've planned to do is
 a good idea. I could easily setup a delim that separates the answer and question then add them to a stack. one stack
  for questions and one for answers. But a problem arises how would I continue to 'regenerate' cards once the stack
  runs out?



----To implement-------

1)FileSaver/Opener - to load the flash cards
2)getting the right index of the flash card answers and questions
once one is done. (maybe running them through a "stack"?)
3)

        /*Try this next, use a JTextArea to write down all the strings
        then dump the text to a file. After doing so when you want to generate questions
        populate an ARRAY-LIST but before hand tokenize them so that the symbol ':' is the delim
        might need to use two lists, now that I think of it.

     UPDATE 6/14/2014: The reason I couldn't write to the file and the name for the current deckName was null is
     because when I created a instance of the FileCreate class it would then lose the deckName variable that was
     stored in memory. To eliminate this problem I needed to create an inner private class that implemented
     ActionListener inside of the DeckCreation class. thus, when the name is saved to the DeckName variable instead
     of building and showing the FlashCardFrame via a constructor I made a method that was invoked keeping the
     FlashCardFrame class within the same FileCreator instance that was created by the DeckCreation class.
